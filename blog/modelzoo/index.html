	<span class="post-date">24 Jun 2022</span>
	<p>Consider two tasks: a classification problem between strawberries and
raspberries and another classification problem between oranges and bananas. The
two tasks are similar and share information relevant to classification. If we can
exploit this information, we can achieve lower generalization errors and
better sample complexities on both these tasks. This motivates us to explore
models that train on multiple tasks.</p>

<p>Caruana’s model <a class="citation" href="#caruana_mtl">(1997)</a> is the most popular
choice, when we want to learn from multiple tasks. It relies on learning a
shared representation function \(f\) across all the tasks. The output of the
function \(f\) is used as input to a task-specific classification layer
\(g_i\), to generate predictions for task \(i\). Formally, the classifier for
task \(i\) is
\begin{equation}
    h_i := g_i \circ f. \nonumber
\end{equation}</p>

<p>In order to tackle our earlier example, we need to learn a single representation \(f\)
for oranges, bananas, strawberries and raspberries. For example, we can learn \(f\)
using a Resnet backbone. The learnable parameters of \(f\) usually make up most
of the parameters in the network since it helps us achieve better sample
complexity bounds <a class="citation" href="#baxter_inductive">(Baxter 2000)</a>. In addition, we need to learn
\(g_1\) and \(g_2\), which are linear layers attached to the Resnet backbone.
\(g_1\) is used to identify if the image is a strawberry or a raspberry and
\(g_2\) is used to determine if the image is a banana or orange.</p>

    </div>
    <span class="caption"> <em>The multi-task model proposed by Rich Caruana continues 
    to remain the most popular architecture when we want to learn from multiple
    tasks; This includes areas like multi-task learning, meta-learning or
    continual learning. The model is trained to minimize the sum of losses on
    all the tasks.</em></span>
</div>

<p>We assume that we know if each image belongs to task 1 or task 2. This helps us
choose the right output head for each input. The model need not distinguish
between a class from task-1 and another class from task-2. For example, the 
model need not distinguish between strawberries and oranges since the two
classes are from different tasks.</p>

<p>Task-incremental continual learning <a class="citation" href="#van2019three">(Van de Ven and Tolias 2019)</a> studies the problem
of learning on a sequence of tasks. The continual learner observes data from
a new task after every “episode” of continual learning. We seek low
generalization errors on all tasks, observed until the current episode. To
achieve this goal, we should leverage information from past tasks, to generalize
better on new tasks and simultaneously use information from the new tasks, to
improve on past tasks.</p>

<p>What does a typical continual learner look like? Most methods train a single
network — one that looks like Caruana’s multi-task model — on a sequence of
tasks. At every episode, the network learns to tackle the new task while trying
to maintain its ability to address past tasks. The latter is enforced using
auxiliary losses or constraints on the gradients.</p>

<h2 id="task-competition">Task Competition</h2>

<p>Caruana’s model assumes that <em>all tasks</em> share a single representation \(f\).
This assumption requires all tasks to be similar to each other, which is less
likely to be true if we have a large number of tasks. Yet, this model continues
to remain the most popular choice architecture, even if we have to tackle many
tasks, like in continual learning.</p>

<p>Under Caruana’s multi-task model, we see that tasks can both help and hurt each
other. The below matrix is representative of distances between
every pair of tasks. It is the decrease (red) or increase (green) in
accuracy when we train two tasks together, compared to training on a single
task. Clearly, not all pairs of tasks benefit each other – evident from the
red cells in the matrix.</p>

<div class="imgcaption">
    <div style="width: 55%;" class="imgcenter">
        <img src="https://rahulramesh.info/public/imgs/modelzoo/task_corr.svg" alt="Task Distances" />
    </div>
    <span class="caption"> <em>The matrix is representative of task distances on 20 5-way
    classification tasks constructed from the CIFAR-100 dataset; Each cell is
    the relative change in accuracy when we train on two tasks as opposed to
    one task. Ideally, we should use this matrix to determine which tasks
    should be trained together. However, estimating this distance matrix is
    expensive, particularly in continual learning, where all tasks are not
    available a priori.</em></span>
</div>

<p>We <a class="citation" href="#modelzoo">(Ramesh and Chaudhari 2022)</a> formalize this idea using the task-competition
theorem. We show that dissimilar tasks fight over the model’s capacity and they
benefit from being trained on separate models. This observation inspires 
us to build Model Zoo, which is capable of expanding its model capacity to
accommodate dissimilar tasks.</p>

<h2 id="model-zoo">Model Zoo</h2>

<p>Model Zoo <a class="citation" href="#modelzoo">(Ramesh and Chaudhari 2022)</a> is a set of models where each model is trained on a subset of tasks.
In the continual learning setup, we add 1 model to the zoo  after every
episode. The model is trained on the new task and a subset of the past tasks
(around 2-4). After \(T\) episodes, Model Zoo is consists of an ensemble of
\(T\) models, which are each trained on a subset of tasks.</p>

<div class="imgcaption">
    <div style="width: 70%;" class="imgcenter">
        <img src="https://rahulramesh.info/public/imgs/modelzoo/zoo.svg" alt="Model Zoo" />
    </div>
    <span class="caption"> <em>The above figure depicts one episode of Model Zoo training.
    The training loss (at the top of the figure) is computed using the first
    two learners. The training loss is used to determine which tasks should be
    trained together in the third model.</em></span>
</div>

<p>The zoo’s output for a particular task is computed by averaging the outputs
of all models trained on that task. For example, the output of the green task
is the average of the green output heads of the first two models. The outputs of the
orange and yellow tasks can be computed using a single model (orange head of
the second model and yellow head of the third model respectively).</p>

<p>Identifying related sets of tasks is the most important component of the
zoo; This determines which tasks are trained together.  Often, figuring out the
relatedness tasks is as expensive as training on those tasks. For continual
learning, we seek an inexpensive proxy for the distance between tasks, in order
to split the tasks into related subsets.</p>

<p>Inspired by Adaboost, we use the training losses of the tasks to identify
which tasks should be trained together. We add a learner to the zoo, which is
trained on tasks with high training losses similar to how a Adaboost trains
learners on samples with high training errors. Even if the zoo performs poorly
on some tasks at episode \(T\), it has the ability to correct itself in future
episodes.</p>

<h2 id="evaluating-the-zoo">Evaluating the Zoo</h2>

<p>Continual learning has many formulations which makes it hard to compare
different methods. They vary on factors like model storage, sample storage
or compute. Methods typically either store no data from previous tasks, or use
a limited replay buffer to store a fraction (around 5-10%) of the data from
previous tasks. Catastrophic forgetting — a tendency of the model to rapidly
forget the solution to past tasks — is commonly observed in these settings and
addressing this, is the primary focus of most existing methods.</p>

<p>In our work, we show that a learner that shares no information between the
tasks i.e., it does no real continual learning, performs better than existing
methods. We call this method <em>Isolated</em> in our work. Isolated has low training times 
and uses no replay buffer but grows it model capacity linearly with the number
of tasks. Existing methods scale well with respect to model size, but fail to
achieve good generalization errors.</p>

<div class="imgcaption">
    <div style="width: 65%;" class="imgcenter">
        <img src="https://rahulramesh.info/public/imgs/modelzoo/isolated_acc.svg" alt="Isolated" />
    </div>
    <span class="caption"> <em>In the above plot, we track the accuracy averaged over all
    tasks, over 20 episodes of continual learning. Different methods are
    evaluated in the single-epoch setting where the model is allowed one epoch of
    training, at every episode of continual learning. Regardless of the
    architecture (a small convolution network or Resnet18-S), Isolated
    outperforms other methods. This indicates that existing methods fail to
    transfer between different tasks. We find a similar trend in the
    multi-epoch setting too.</em></span>
</div>

<p>Model Zoo on the other hand, is able to outperform the Isolated baseline. It
improves on previous tasks (backward transfer) and has an improved ability to
solve new tasks (forward transfer). The zoo has low training and inference
times compared to other methods but grows its model capacity at every
episode and uses a replay buffer.</p>

    </div>
    <span class="caption"> <em>We track the accuracy of each task from the
    Split-MiniImagenet dataset which consists of 20 5-way classification
    problems. 'X', which denote the accuracy of Isolated on a new task, is
    usually lower accuracy than Model Zoo's accuracy on the same task when it
    is first seen. Additionally, the accuracy of past tasks improve over
    episodes of continual learning.</em></span>
</div>

<p>Model Zoo shows that growing the capacity of the model, can help us build
effective continual learners. If you are interested in exploring Model Zoos,
